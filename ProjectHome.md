Simple to use Python API to interact with Omegle.

This API will be updated as often as needed.  Please submit bug reports and patches.  It's far from complete.  I add features as I use them.  If you'd like to see a feature added, put it in issues (with a patch, if you've got one).

Uses Omegle's REST/JSON interface.

Based off of py-omegle and pyomegle.
